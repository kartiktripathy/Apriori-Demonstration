# Apriori-Demonstration
This repository is a demonstration of the Apriori package in Python , which is mostly used for Assosiation Rule Learning-a branch of Machine Learning .
Assosiation Rule Learning aims at building certain rules of assosiations among the classes and features as provided in the dataset to come up with a confidence level for the assosiation among certaing things which are incalculable to humans sometimes.
The dataset is the list of items purchased by customers in a shooping mall. The models helps in building the rules of assosiations among the purchases so that the mall accordingly decides the placing and that may improve the sales of the organisation.
At the end the model prints certain rules according to their descending order of confidence levels.
This model is quite useful for the supermartkets and such organisations and is proven to improve their sales multiple times.
